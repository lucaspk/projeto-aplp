The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl
The way she moved
Her hair her face her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew but I was
Walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone
My baby cried
She left me standing alone
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch a kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return
Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew
But I was living in vain
She called my house
She said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine
I can not sleep alone tonight
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby
And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
'Cause it's dangerous
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one but the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice just remember to always think twice
(Don't think twice don't think twice)
She told my baby we'd danced till three then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried his eyes were like mine (oh no!)
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one but the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
(You know what you did (she says he is my son)breaking my heart babe)
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover (don't Billie Jean)
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover

Nation to nation all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see
Then maybe somehow we can work it out.
I asked my neighbor for a favor she said later.
What has come of all the people have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be.
False prophets cry of doom what are the possibilities?

The world keeps changing rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom the baby boom has come of age we'll work it out.
I told my brother don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system don't you talk to me don't scream and shout.
She pray to God to Buddha then she sings a Talmud song.
Confusions contradict the self do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me I'm the temple
You can't hurt me I found peace within myself.
Go with it go with it.
Jam. It ain't it ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much it ain't too much for me to jam.

Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal that's the man Mike's so relaxed.
Mingle mingle jingle in the jungle bum rushed to door 3 and 4's in a bundle.
Execute the plan first I cooled like a fan
Got with Janet then with Guy now with Michael 'cause it ain't hard to

Remember those walls I built
Well baby they're tumbling down
And they didn't even put up a fight
They didn't even make a sound
I found a way to let you win
But I never really had a doubt
Standing in the light of your halo
I got my angel now
It's like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you break it
It's the risk that I'm taking
I ain't never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace
You're everything I need and more
It's written all over your face
Baby I can feel your halo
Pray it won't fade away
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo

Hit me like a ray of sun
Burning through my darkest night
You're the only one that I want
Think I'm addicted to your light
I swore I'd never fall again
But this don't even feel like falling
Gravity can't forget
To pull me back to the ground again
Feels like I've been awakened
Every rule I had you break it
The risk that I'm taking
I'm never gonna shut you out
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace

I wake up with blood-shot eyes
Struggled to memorize
The way it felt between your thighs
Pleasure that made you cry
Feels so good to be bad
Not worth the aftermath after that
After that
Try to get you back
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to try
Yeah so this is goodbye
God damn my spinning head
Decisions that made my bed
Now I must lay in it
And deal with things I left unsaid
I want to dive into you
Forget what you're going through
I get behind; make your move
Forget about the truth
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you
Give me something to believe in
'Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try (yeah)
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true
Anymore anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
I've been here before
One day I'm wake up
And it won't hurt anymore
You caught me in a lie
I have no alibi
The words you say don't have a meaning
Cause
I still don't have the reason
And you don't have the time
And it really makes me wonder
If I ever gave a fuck about you and I
And so this is goodbye
Give me something to believe in
Cause I don't believe in you
Anymore anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference
It even makes a difference to try
And you told me how you're feeling
But I don't believe it's true
Anymore anymore
I wonder if it even makes a difference to cry
(Oh no)
So this is goodbye
So this is goodbye yeah
So this is goodbye yeah
So this is goodbye yeah

I live on raw emotion baby
I answer questions never maybe
And I'm not kind if you betray me
So who the hell are you to save me?
I never would have made it babe
If you needed love
Well then ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
'Cause you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word
Wake up call
Caught you in the morning with another one in my bed
Don't you care about me anymore?
Don't you care about me?
I don't think so
Six foot tall
Came without a warning so I had to shoot him dead
He won't come around here anymore
Come around here?
I don't think so
Would have bled to make you happy
You didn't need to treat me that way
And now you beat me at my own game
And now I'm finally sleeping soundly
And your lover's screaming loudly
I hear a sound and hit the ground
If you needed love
Well then ask for love
Could have given love
Now I'm taking love
And it's not my fault
'Cause you both deserve
What's coming now
So don't say a word
Wake up call
